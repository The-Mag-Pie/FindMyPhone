# FindMyPhone
Simple app for Android and Tizen Galaxy Wearable to finding a phone
# Why did I create it?
I know that Samsung Wearables have builin function to find the phone but it works only if you have your media channel unmuted. My app works on alarm channel which is less often muted than media.
# Installation
1. Build apk in Android Studio
2. Install apk in Android device
3. Build package in Tizen Studio and install it on Wearable device
4. Enjoy
# IMPORTANT!
As the app uses the alarm channel, you can't have it muted.
